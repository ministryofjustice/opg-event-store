The Ministry of Justice and the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) are working on a project to **modernise lasting powers of attorney**.

The project aims to:

- increase safeguards for the donor
- improve the process of making and registering an LPA for donors, attorneys and third parties
- achieve sustainability for OPG whilst keeping LPAs as affordable as possible for all people in society
